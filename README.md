# Hi, I'm Shehjad

_Software Engineer | Full-Stack | TypeScript | NestJS | NextJS | Linux | DevOps Enthusiast_

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a software engineer with a deep-rooted passion for building and scaling applications for the web. While I specialize in full-stack development, my strengths lean toward backend architecture, designing robust systems, and leading projects. Iâ€™m driven by the process of turning ideas into viable MVPs, especially in dynamic startup environments. When I'm not building software, I enjoy diving into new tech, exploring best practices in system design, and sharing insights through writing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on few side projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Microservices, Kubernetes, and System Design**
- ðŸŒŸ I'm looking to contribute to open-source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Software Development, Project Management, or anything technology-related**
- ðŸ“« Reach me at **hello@shehjad.dev** or **shehjadcse@gmail.com**
