# Hi, I'm Shehjad

_Software Engineer | Full-Stack | TypeScript | NestJS | NextJS | DevOps Enthusiast_

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a software engineer with a deep-rooted passion for building and scaling applications for the web. While I specialize in full-stack development, my strengths lean toward backend architecture, designing robust systems, and leading projects. Iâ€™m driven by the process of turning ideas into viable MVPs, especially in dynamic startup environments. When I'm not building software, I enjoy diving into new tech, exploring best practices in system design, and sharing insights through writing.
